### Folder Structure Instructions

After downloading the files, create a folder named `data` in the root directory of this project and organize the datasets as follows:

```
data/
│
├── Problem01/
│     └── (files for Problem 01)
│
├── Problem02/
│     └── (files for Problem 02)
│
└── Problem03/
      └── (files for Problem 03)
```

Ensure that the folder names match exactly as shown above so that all notebooks run without requiring path modifications.
