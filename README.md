# Applied DataAnalytics(ADA) Projects
This repository contains projects completed during my ADA course:


## Project 01. **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting for Network Link Utilization**

This project applies time series forecasting techniques to predict future **network link utilization** using hourly data. The workflow includes data cleaning, preprocessing, resampling to hourly frequency, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis. Three forecasting approaches are implemented: **Linear Regression** with lag features, **ARIMA**, and **Exponential Smoothing**. Each model generates a seven-day forecast, with performance evaluated using R², MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The study compares model strengths and limitations, highlights trends and seasonality, and provides computational insights for reliable forecasting of network utilization.
